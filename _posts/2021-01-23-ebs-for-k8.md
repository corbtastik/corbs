You get a volume, you get a volume, you, and you and you get a volume!  Being able to provision "elastic block storage" volumes can be quite gratifying, especially for those seeking to run stateful workloads on K8s.

Thankfully we're seeing great tech emerge, on top of K8s primitives to provide a smooth cloud native storage experience that brings out the inner Oprah in all of us.  In this post we'll explore one of the most important capabilities to have on a K8s cluster...elastic storage...awe yeah.

## Storage on K8s

"State" is an important aspect of computing, which represents events in a systems, and being able to "remember" state makes a system "stateful".
